# PrefillAndOneClickSendingAgreement Sample Application

## Use Case Overview

This sample application demonstrates how to use the SignNow platform to implement a **Form and One Click Send** workflow. It is designed for scenarios where a single recipient needs to sign a document based on form input. The application streamlines the process by allowing users to fill out a form, send an invitation for signing, and monitor the signing status with minimal steps.

## Scenario: ISV with Form and One Click Send

### Step-by-step:

1. **Form Input**
    - The user is presented with a web form containing the following fields:
        - **Name**: A required text input field.
        - **Email**: A required email input field.
    - After completing the form, the user clicks the **Continue** button to proceed.

2. **Document Pre-fill and Invitation Sending**
    - Upon clicking **Continue**, the application pre-fills the **Name** field in the document using the form input.
    - An invitation is sent to the email address provided in the form.
    - The user is then automatically redirected to the next step.

3. **Send Status Page**
    - The user is directed to a status monitoring page to track the progress of the signing process.
    - A **Refresh** button is available for manually updating the status.
    - The page displays the current status of the document (e.g., sent, viewed, signed).
    - Once the document is signed, the user can download the final signed document.

## Technical Flow

1. **Form Submission**
    - The application captures form data upon submission and uses it to pre-fill document fields.
    - The backend processes the data, clones the document from a predefined template, and sends an invitation to the recipient's email.

2. **Invitation Sending**
    - The application utilizes the template named "Membership Program Agreement (Retail)" with the TemplateId: 'e30d6e58c82d43f598e365420f3c665a048a7d81'.
    - The invitation is sent to the email address provided in the form.

3. **Status Monitoring**
    - The user is redirected to the status page to monitor the signing process.
    - The application periodically checks the status of the invitation and updates the user interface.
    - The user can manually refresh the status by clicking the **Refresh** button.

4. **Document Download**
    - Once the document is signed, the user can download the signed document.
    - The user clicks the **Download Document** button to retrieve the completed document.

## User Interaction Summary

- **Initial Interaction**: User fills out the form with their name and email.
- **Invitation Process**: The application pre-fills the document and sends an invitation to the provided email.
- **Status Monitoring**: User monitors the signing status and refreshes the page as needed.
- **Completion**: User downloads the signed document once the process is complete.

This flow ensures a seamless experience for users who need to quickly send documents for signing with minimal steps involved.

## Configuration Notes

- **Template ID**: The template used is "Membership Program Agreement (Retail)" with TemplateId: 'e30d6e58c82d43f598e365420f3c665a048a7d81'.
- **SignNow SDK**: This application leverages the SignNow platform for document management and signing processes.
