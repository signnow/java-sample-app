# Embedded Sender Sample Application: Credit Loan Agreement with Multiple Recipients

## Use Case Overview

This sample demonstrates how to use the SignNow Java SDK to implement an **Embedded Sender With Form** workflow that allows:

1. Collecting user data via a web form.
2. Configuring multiple recipients (including sender as signer).
3. Sending invitations for embedded signing.
4. Monitoring invitation statuses.
5. Downloading the final signed document.

The flow is suitable for business scenarios where a form-based agreement (e.g., credit loan) requires signatures from multiple parties.

## Scenario: Embedded Sender With Form and Multiple Recipients

### Step-by-step:

1. **Form Input**
    - Display a form asking for **Name** (required) and **Email** (optional).
    - User fills the form and clicks **Continue** to proceed.

2. **Custom Send Invite Page**
    - Pre-configured with **3 recipients**:
        - Recipient 1: **Sender as Signer** (checkbox checked and disabled).
        - Recipient 2: Email pre-filled from the form's Email field.
        - Recipient 3: Blank email field.
    - All recipient emails are required.
    - User clicks **Send Invite** to generate an embedded signing link for Recipient 1 and move to status monitoring.

3. **Embedded Signing Session**
    - An embedded signing link is created and opened for Recipient 1 within the application.

4. **Send Status Page**
    - The app polls the backend every 3 seconds to retrieve current email statuses for all recipients.
    - Displays a list of recipients, their status timestamps, and a badge indicating status (e.g., sent, viewed, signed).
    - Includes a **Refresh** button (automated polling) and a **Finish Demo** button to proceed.

5. **Finish Page**
    - A confirmation screen indicating the process is complete.
    - Option to start a new session or exit the demo.

## Technical Flow

1. **GET Request Handling**
    - No `page` parameter: renders the initial form.
    - `?page=download-with-status`: renders the status monitoring view.

2. **Form Submission & Redirect**
    - On form submit, JavaScript captures form values and redirects to the custom send-invite controller endpoint with query parameters.

3. **Template Cloning & Invite Creation**
    - Backend clones a document from the predefined template ID.
    - Pre-fills form fields and sets up recipient invites (including sender as signer).
    - Generates an embedded sending link via `DocumentEmbeddedSendingLinkPostRequest` with a redirect back to status monitoring.

4. **Status Polling & Rendering**
    - Frontend polls the backend with `action: 'invite-status'`.
    - Backend fetches invites via `DocumentGetRequest`, extracts email statuses, formats timestamps, and returns JSON.
    - Frontend renders status list and handles download actions.

5. **Document Download**
    - When a recipient completes signing, the frontend displays **Download Document** buttons.
    - On click, sends `action: 'download'` to fetch the flattened PDF and triggers browser download.

## Configuration Notes

- **Template ID**: Defined in the controller (e.g., `de45a9a2a6014c2c8ac0a4d9057b17a2108e77e7`).
- **Redirect URL**: Configured to point back to the status page with the document ID.
- **SignNow SDK**: Uses the official SignNow Java SDK; credentials loaded from environment settings.

# ISV with Form and One Click Send - Merge Fields

This sample demonstrates how to create a document group from a document group template, process merge fields by adding permanent text elements, and send invites to multiple recipients with different roles. The sample showcases SignNow SDK integration for document group management, merge field processing using DocumentPut, and automated invite sending.

## Use Case Overview

This sample addresses the common business scenario where ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) need to:
- Collect customer information through a web form
- Create documents from templates with merge fields
- Process merge fields by adding permanent, read-only text elements at field coordinates
- Send documents to multiple recipients with different roles
- Track signing status and provide download functionality

The sample is particularly useful for businesses that need to automate document workflows with multiple signers and merge field processing using permanent text elements.

## Scenario Description

The sample implements a complete document workflow where:

1. **Customer Information Collection**: Users fill out a form with customer name, company name, and email
2. **Document Creation**: A document group is created from a template with merge fields
3. **Merge Fields Processing**: Customer and company names are added as permanent, read-only text elements at merge field coordinates using DocumentPut, making them part of the document content
4. **Recipient Assignment**: Different recipients are assigned based on roles with specific email addresses
5. **Invite Sending**: Documents are automatically sent to all recipients
6. **Status Tracking**: Users can monitor signing progress and download completed documents

### Step-by-step:

1. **Form Page**: User enters customer name, company name, and email address
2. **Document Group Creation**: Backend creates a document group from the specified template
3. **Merge Fields Processing**: Customer and company names are added as permanent text elements at merge field coordinates using DocumentPut, making them part of the document content
4. **Recipient Configuration**: 
   - "Prepare Contract" role gets the email from the form
   - "Customer to Sign" role gets a specific test email address
5. **Invite Sending**: Documents are sent to all recipients automatically
6. **Status Page**: User is redirected to status page to monitor progress
7. **Download**: Completed documents can be downloaded as merged PDF

## Technical Flow

## Technical Implementation Details

### Merge Fields Processing

The sample processes merge fields by:
1. **Identifying merge fields**: Locates `CustomerName` and `CompanyName` fields in documents
2. **Creating text elements**: Adds permanent text elements at merge field coordinates using DocumentPut
3. **Preserving other fields**: Maintains all other fields in the document
4. **Making content permanent**: Text elements become part of the document and cannot be modified by signers

### Recipient Email Assignment

The sample assigns emails based on recipient roles:
- **"Prepare Contract"**: Uses email from the form
- **"Customer to Sign"**: Uses a specific test email address for demonstration

### DocumentPut Implementation

The sample uses DocumentPut to:
- Create permanent text elements at merge field coordinates
- Preserve document structure and other fields
- Make merge field content part of the document itself
